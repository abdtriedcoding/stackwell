# Stackwell

Agency management platform with zero seat tax. Scale your team without scaling your software bill.

## The Problem

Most agency platforms bundle all the right features,
but **price growth into your headcount** while still holding back essentials.

You’re not just paying more as your team grows.  
You’re often **still not getting a fully branded client experience**.

### What a 10-Person Agency Typically Pays

A common professional-tier pricing model looks like this:

- **Professional plan**: $149/month  
  (includes 3 internal users)
- **Additional team members**: $39 per user

For a 10-person team:

- Included users: 3
- Additional users: 7 × $39 = **$273**
- **Total monthly cost**:  
  **$149 + $273 = $422/month**
- **Total yearly cost**:  
  **$5,064/year**

This is for **one bundled platform** that includes:

- Project management
- Client portal
- File sharing
- Billing & invoicing

And even at **$422/month**:

- Full white-labeling is **not included**
- Platform branding is still visible to clients
- Advanced branding requires higher tiers or enterprise plans

You pay enterprise-level pricing,
without getting an enterprise-level brand experience.

## The Solution

Stackwell is a unified platform for agencies that scales with your ambition, not your headcount.

**One branded environment** to handle your entire client lifecycle:

- Client portal (white-labeled by default)
- Project management
- File sharing & collaboration
- Automated billing & invoicing

## Core Differentiators

### 1. Zero Seat Tax

Unlimited team members on every plan. Whether you have 2 employees or 20 contractors, your software bill stays flat.

### 2. No Vanity Tax

Professional white-labeling isn't an "enterprise" luxury. It's baseline. We give you your own branded portal without the $400 price tag.

### 3. Unified Context

Stop losing 20% of your day switching between Slack, Trello, and Stripe. Everything about a client lives in one place:

- Conversation history
- Project files
- Invoices & billing
- Project status
